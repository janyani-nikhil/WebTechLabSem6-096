        There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought heâ€™ll win this easily. So he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going. When the hare woke
        up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping. </p>
